**Problem Statement**

Agricultural productivity relies on understanding and managing soil conditions to match the nutrient requirements of specific crops. With varying needs for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), 
and potassium (K), as well as sensitivity to soil temperature and pH levels, it is critical for farmers to determine which crops are most suitable for their soil conditions to optimize yield.

This dataset includes key soil properties—nutrient levels (N, P, K), average soil temperature (°F), and pH (acidity or basicity)—and maps them to specific crop types 
(e.g., rice, maize, various legumes, fruits, and cash crops like cotton and coffee). Using this data, we aim to develop a predictive model that suggests the most suitable crop types 
based on given soil characteristics.

**Objective**

To build a machine learning model that recommends the best crop(s) based on soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), temperature, and pH, thereby supporting informed decision-making for 
farmers and improving agricultural efficiency.

**Goals**

Analyze Soil-Condition Requirements for Different Crops: Explore the soil nutrient composition, temperature, and pH ranges ideal for each crop in the dataset.

Develop Predictive Model: Train a classification model that suggests optimal crop choices based on the input conditions of N, P, K levels, temperature, and pH.

Evaluate Model Accuracy: Assess the model's accuracy in correctly recommending crop types by validating it against test data. Provide Insights for Crop Rotation or Soil Amendment: 
Use the model to suggest soil amendments or crop rotation strategies to achieve better suitability for desired crops.
